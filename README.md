PROJECT PORTFOLIO
by : Collin Moe

In this Repository is a set of projects; In order from which I made them in my Computational Physics class.
Much thanks to Dr. Aaron Titus, my professor that aided me in much of my work coding these projects to model the physics correctly.

Project 0 - is a project in which Justin Chen and I modeled electrons moving through a material using the Drude model.

Project 1 - is a project in which I modeled a Rocket with a few stipulations, starting with no gravity and no fuel jettisons, and added those later on.

Project 2 - is a project in which Kolt Byers and I modeled a realistic Curve ball using the magnus effect as well as drag coefficient to show the path of a real curveball

Project 3 - is a project in which I started by creating a circle loop of points, and then was able to animate them into a vibrating hoop.

Final Project - is a project in which I extended upon Project 2 and used that realistic Curve ball and made it into a spray chart of curveballs while testing multiple variables.

Although these projects are not perfect and infact some of them treat reality as though it is perfect, I was able to create these in a short amount of time and will keep developing them and improving them as I grow my level of coding and understanding of greater amounts of physics.
