PROJECT PORTFOLIO

PHYSICS!! 

In this Repository is a set of projects; In order from which I made them in my Computational Physics class.
First off, I want to give great thanks to Dr. Aaron Titus, my professor that aided me in much of my work coding these projects to model the physics correctly. A few of the physics topics i went into whie coding deals with the ODE/RK4 methods, coupled oscillators, Air resistence (Drag / Magnus effect). Much of the physics and coding improves as I take steps into each project. In this repository you will see failures and success, determination to figure out these diffcult problems, as well as a great amount of team cooperation when working with my fellow students. I also was given great amount of help from Dr.Titus and after finishing these projects the first time was able to fix these with his help to make them greater in their own respect.

Project 0 - is a project in which Justin Chen and I modeled electrons moving through a material using the Drude model, and animated the process.

Project 1 - is a project in which I modeled a Rocket with a few stipulations, starting with no gravity and no fuel jettisons, and added those later on to add to the realism that is rocket flight.

Project 2 - is a project in which Kolt Byers and I modeled a realistic Curve ball using the magnus effect as well as drag coefficient to show the path of a real curveball through a loop of many time steps to show the entire curveball.

Project 3 - is a project in which I started by creating a circle loop of points, and then was able to animate them into a vibrating hoop.

Final Project - is a project in which I extended upon Project 2 and used that realistic Curve ball and made it into a spray chart of curveballs while testing multiple variables.

Although these projects are not perfect and infact some of them treat reality as though it is perfect, I was able to create these in a short amount of time and will keep developing them and improving them as I grow my level of coding and understanding of greater amounts of physics.
